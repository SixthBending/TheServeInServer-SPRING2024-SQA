### Report
Our knowledge came from the collection of each other and the given workshops throughout the semester. First we unzippped the file, we created a file within .git/hooks/pre-commit to run a scan on all security weaknesses using the code: bandit . -r, creating a fuzz.py file, integrating forensics, with continous integration into github.
